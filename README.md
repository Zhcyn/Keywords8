This project started with something I wanted to cross off my word list: learn eight new words every day to help improve my vocabulary. I also want to create an iOS application, so I decided to complete two tasks at once: create an application to help me improve my vocabulary. \n\u{2022} Currently, the word book only extracts words from 3 sites, but more words will be added in the future!
